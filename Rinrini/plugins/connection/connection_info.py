    "• /connect - Do this in the chat you want to connect to and I'll send a button there which you can tap to get the chat connected, you can also use the chat's id. (Example: `/connect <id>`) - you'll execute this in my PM.\n\n"
    "• /disconnect - Disconnect my PM with the chat you connected.\n\n"
    "• /reconnect - I'll reconnect to the last chat you connected.\n\n"
    "• /connection - There are obviously some things that cannot be done when connected to PM, this will get you the list of all possible commands that can be executed when connected to PM.\n\n"
    "• /allowconnection - Enable this if you want to let your members connect and be able to view notes/filters, disable if you don't want them to. (Bool values: `yes/no/on/off`)"
